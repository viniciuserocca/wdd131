            <p>My name is Vinicius, I am 24 years old, and I have always had a love for technology since I was a teenager. I have been working as an SAP SD consultant for a year and a half now, and it has been a very rewarding and rewarding experience, I have been able to learn a lot about ERP systems, and how to optimize the sales and distribution process in large companies, thus improving the company's performance considerably. During this time, SAP has also become a passion, and I always seek to improve myself and acquire new knowledge about the SD module. I am willing to dedicate myself deeply to learning about new technologies that make work more efficient and productive, always looking for a way to apply this in my day-to-day work in companies.</p>
